## Building `dist` folder

To build `dist/` folder we utilize `highlight.js` standard way:
1. Copy the source
2. Symlink our project to `extra/` directory
3. Run the script

To automate this proccess, use `bash scripts/build.sh`

**Make sure that you run build script for each new package release**!
